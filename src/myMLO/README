The Makefile will generate an MLO file. This file needs to be placed on a
FAT filesysetm compatible with the TI AM335x ROM Code.

The mkAM355xImg tool is in the tools directory with its own Makefile

To generate the partition:
  Calculate the number of cylinders as:
  $C = FLOOR((Total Number of Bytes on Card) / 255 / 63 / 512)
  Note:
    fdisk can give you number of bytes on device 
    FLOOR is the truncated value of the calculation
      eg. FLOOR(25.6) = 25
  Setup partion using fdisk:
    fdisk -u=cylinders -b 512 -H 255 -S 63 -C <$C> <dev>
      At this point the device geometry is set up.
    - Create a primary partition with size of 50 (+50) cylinders.
    - Mark partition as bootable
    - Set partition type as c (W95 FAT32 (LBA))
  Create the file system:
    mkfs.msdos -F 32 <dev> -n <label>

Copy the MLO file onto the partition and you are ready too boot.
